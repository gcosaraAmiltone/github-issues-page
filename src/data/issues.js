It assumes that the node_modules living higher up in the tree is accidental, which is not.\r\n\r\nI do not want to skip preflight checks because:\r\n1. This is production content, I cannot take risks\r\n2. Seems like we cannot disable only that check\r\n\r\n![Capture du 2020-01-16 14-48-57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15984272/72530357-7e513d00-386f-11ea-9bed-25d763cad89f.png)\r\n\r\n### Reproducible demo\r\n\r\nI believe the steps to reproduce, do reproduce the problem in every case.\r\n\r\nIf you really can't reproduce, I will make a demo repo.\r\n\r\nThank you"

First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  There are a few common documented problems, such as watcher not detecting changes, or build failing.\r\n  They are described in the Troubleshooting section of the User Guide:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting\r\n\r\n  Please scan these few sections for common problems.\r\n  Additionally, you can search the User Guide itself for something you're having issues with:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/\r\n\r\n  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.\r\n  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nparentheses, strip, css\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.4 Arch Linux\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 13.6.0 - /usr/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.21.1 - /usr/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.13.6 - /usr/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: Not Found\r\n    Firefox: 72.0.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: Not Found\r\n    react-dom: Not Found\r\n    react-scripts: Not Found\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn’t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your steps here:)\r\n\r\n1. import the following css:\r\n```css\r\n  body .chat-wrapper {\r\n    padding: 0 calc(((100vw - 1140px) / 2) - (1.5rem + 24px));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n2. run `build`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nthe parentheses are kept because they are semantically different than without them\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Please attach screenshots if possible! They are extremely helpful for diagnosing issues.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nthe css is compiled to: `body .chat-wrapper{max-width:100vw;padding:0 calc((100vw - 1140px)/2 - 1.5rem + 24px)}` (missing required parentheses around `1.5rem + 24px`)\r\n\r\n### Reproducible demo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you can, please share a project that reproduces the issue.\r\n  This is the single most effective way to get an issue fixed soon.\r\n\r\n  There are two ways to do it:\r\n\r\n    * Create a new app and try to reproduce the issue in it.\r\n      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can’t share the real code.\r\n\r\n    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you’re left with the minimal reproducible demo.\r\n      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a new project.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once you’re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/SampsonCrowley/css-bug-demo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n\r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,\r\n  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.\r\n\r\n  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might\r\n  create a reproducible example for it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\n"

I recently ran into unexpected functionality in production build. https://github.com/AriPerkkio/asus-merlin-simple-vpn-client-setup/issues/1\r\nThe code works just fine on development mode but breaks on production build. I've traced the bug into a switch-case block which produces incorrect results after transpile process. I could debug this further but don't have much time for this now. I've prepared a minimal reproduce branch for this, see below.\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your module tree might be corrupted, and that might be causing the issues.\r\n  Let's try to recover it. First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, I've ran `rm -rf node_modules/ yarn.lock`. \r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  There are a few common documented problems, such as watcher not detecting changes, or build failing.\r\n  They are described in the Troubleshooting section of the User Guide:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting\r\n\r\n  Please scan these few sections for common problems.\r\n  Additionally, you can search the User Guide itself for something you're having issues with:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/\r\n\r\n  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.\r\n  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRead it many times, great documentation!\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Linux 4.19 Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch) 9 (stretch)\r\n    CPU: (4) x64 06/8e\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 13.6.0 - /usr/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.21.1 - /usr/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.13.4 - /usr/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: Not Found\r\n    Firefox: Not Found\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.12.0 => 16.12.0 \r\n    react-dom: ^16.12.0 => 16.12.0 \r\n    react-scripts: 3.3.0 => 3.3.0 \r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: Not Found\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn’t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/AriPerkkio/asus-merlin-simple-vpn-client-setup.git\r\n$ cd asus-merlin-simple-vpn-client-setup\r\n$ git checkout transpile-bug\r\n$ yarn # Install dependencies\r\n$ yarn build # Builds minimal setup and runs prettier on it\r\n# Check build/ui/static/js/main.<hash>.chunk.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nInput:\r\n```js\r\ncase 'B': {\r\n    const { key } = action;\r\n    const keys = state.keys.map(_key =>\r\n        _key.id === key.id ? key : _key\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    return { ...state, keys };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnexpected output in build:\r\n```js\r\ncase 'B':\r\n    t.key;\r\n    var i = e.keys.map(function(e) {\r\n        return e.id, e.id, e;\r\n    });\r\n    return c({}, e, { keys: i });\r\n```\r\n\r\nRename `_key`\r\n```js\r\ncase 'B': {\r\n    const { key } = action;\r\n    const keys = state.keys.map(_someKey =>\r\n        _someKey.id === key.id ? key : _someKey\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    return { ...state, keys };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput is as expected:\r\n```js\r\ncase 'B':\r\n    var i = t.key,\r\n        u = e.keys.map(function(e) {\r\n            return e.id === i.id ? i : e;\r\n        });\r\n    return c({}, e, { keys: u });\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Please attach screenshots if possible! They are extremely helpful for diagnosing issues.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible demo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you can, please share a project that reproduces the issue.\r\n  This is the single most effective way to get an issue fixed soon.\r\n\r\n  There are two ways to do it:\r\n\r\n    * Create a new app and try to reproduce the issue in it.\r\n      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can’t share the real code.\r\n\r\n    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you’re left with the minimal reproducible demo.\r\n      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a new project.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once you’re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSee steps to reproduce.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n\r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,\r\n  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.\r\n\r\n  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might\r\n  create a reproducible example for it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\n"

      "body": "### Is your proposal related to a problem?\r\n\r\n> Sometimes, you start a project as an \"app\", and it perfectly fits. But then, later, your app grows, and what was an \"app\" before becomes a \"module\" within a bigger app. \r\n> \r\n> And at this point you may get stuck because you can't import that \"module\" as a node dependency, and **that can be a real blocker for product growth**.\r\n\r\nThis has potential to be more and more a real blocker, especially because of universal apps (like Next.js) that could have the ability to \"just import\" CRA apps, but can't, because of this CRA's limitation.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAssuming I write a CRA app `my-cra-app`, and I want to use this app in another node.js project - _such as Next.s_ -, I'd like to import it that way:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nimport MyApp from 'my-cra-app'; // The CRA app loaded as a node.js module\r\nimport React from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst MyCustomCraApp: React.FunctionComponent<Props> = (props: Props): JSX.Element => {\r\n  const { prop2 } = props;\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <MyApp\r\n      prop1={true}\r\n      prop2={prop2}\r\n    />\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\ntype Props = {\r\n  prop2: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default MyCustomCraApp;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the only possibility is to load a CRA app on the browser-side. Meaning loading the CSS and JS files in the <head> section, and creating a DOM element that matches the element where gets injected the CRA app.\r\n\r\nI haven't found any solution to load a CRA app as a node.js module, and it's therefore not SSR compatible. (loading has to happens on the client side)\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nDiscussed with the community at https://spectrum.chat/create-react-app/general/how-to-convert-a-cra-app-into-a-package~23fd401e-ebb4-409f-9c8f-599fdddb0882\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's technically doable, nor how hard it might be.\r\n"

Unfortunately this version of `webpack-dev-server` has a bug (https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/2313) that breaks using the dev server with ssl on Chrome (linux).\r\n\r\nThe issue is fixed in `webpack-dev-server@^3.10.1`\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your module tree might be corrupted, and that might be causing the issues.\r\n  Let's try to recover it. First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOS: CentOS Linux 7\r\nNode: 10.4.0\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn’t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Enable SSL for dev server on Linux using `react-scripts@3.3.0`\r\n2. View site in Chrome\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nCertificate is invalid, but able to be accepted anyway.\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nChrome reports certificate is invalid, but scrambled. User cannot accept the certificate to view the site. (Writeup with screenshots is available here: https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/2313)\r\n\r\nIf I revert to `react-scripts@3.2.0`, the site works as expected.\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Please attach screenshots if possible! They are extremely helpful for diagnosing issues.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n"

      "body": "Intolerance of \"outdated\" versions means that you have to be 100% right, 100% of the time AND all of your dependencies have to right 100% of the time.  If I try `npx create-react-app@3.0.1 my-app` you get this problem `This is likely because you're using an outdated version`.\r\n\r\nIn 3.1.0, SASS module composition is broken (but not in 3.0.1).  But if you try to work around this breakage by specifying the @3.0.1 you get the above message and a mostly empty project directory.  This is not all that useful.  This happens even if you specify `--template=typescript`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpx create-react-app@3.0.1 --template=typescript zee\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand that to cut down on support this might seem like the right path, but I think it basically means that trying to spin up a react project now is even more of a crapshoot than it has been in the past since random things will still be broken, but rolling back to a good working version will no longer work.  \r\n\r\nI thought the aim of this project was to make it easier to get started, but this path is going to lead to more headaches, not less.\r\n\r\nRight now my workaround is create a busted project using the head branch, then create a usable project using @3.0.1, then copying over the missing pieces from the busted project so that in the end I can have a working project that doesn't break sass module based imports.  All of this could be resolved by allowing the user to rollback using the @ mechanism in npx.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nDon't take away the templates just because the latest version of create-react-app wasn't used.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nSee my workarounds above.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI'm trying to repair an existing CRA app that has drifted too far in versions from anything that remotely seems to allow things to work.  I'm trying to build a baseline I can use to build, test, storybook this project and feel that my head is bruised from banging into your walls."

      "body": "### Is your proposal related to a problem?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on a custom version of react-scripts for my company to use so that we can build new react-apps with our own webpack configs & pre-installed dependencies. However, the problem is that in `createReactApp.js` line 436, `const templatesVersionMinimum = '3.3.0';` it makes it so that in order for CRA to actually build the src files properly I have to specify a minimum package version of `3.3.0` I get the motivation for that code. However, if I'm working on a new customized version of a package, I don't really want to start at version 3.3.0, I want to start at 0.0.1 or at least 1.0.0. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI think the `templatesVersionMinimum` constant being set to `3.3.0` should really only be applied if you intend to use the default package of react-scripts that CRA uses. Otherwise it really shouldn't have that limit in place, because other people might not want to begin their package versioning at 3.3.0. Of course, people using custom-react scripts intending to use templates would need to be sure their customizations don't break the template support introduced in 3.3.0 so I guess the scope expands a bit further than simply setting a conditional wherein that `templatesVersionMinimum` isn't set at all when a non-default react-scripts is specified.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\n1. Setting my package version to `3.3.0`\r\n--This works, but I mean it's pretty gross.\r\n\r\n2. Leaving modern society and living in a cave eating berries\r\n--This doesn't _fix_ the problem per se. But it does remove it from a being a problem I need to deal with. Not an ideal solution either."

This is because the [git repo is initialized after template dependencies are installed](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/scripts/init.js#L268).\r\n\r\nAn example is a very popular package [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) which adds git hooks to `.git` directory as part of its postinstall scripts. Those hooks won't be added for the person setting up the app with `npx create-react-app ...`\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n- split [tryGitInit()](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/scripts/init.js#L44) into 2 separate functions - one that initializes the repo, second that creates commit.\r\n-  move execution of the first function up, possible at the beginning of main [`init.js function`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/scripts/init.js#L85)\r\n\r\nIf you are OK with the proposed solution I'll be happy to prepare PR with the implementation.\r\n"
